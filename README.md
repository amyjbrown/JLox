# JLox
Custom Implementation of the Lox language in Java via Bob Nystrom's Crafting Interpreters (https://craftinginterpreters.com)
This implementation hopes to add several of the challenge features discussed in the book

Currently added bonus features:
  * Multiline nested comments, using the familiar `/*` and `*/`. These may be nested multiple times, so that
    `/* Nesting 1 /* Nesting 2  /* Nesting 3 */ */ */`
